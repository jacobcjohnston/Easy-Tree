# Easy Tree

**Easy Tree** is a Blender add-on that lets you quickly create and customize procedural trees using Geometry Nodes — no manual node editing required.

Designed for flexibility and ease of use, it includes both one-click presets and modular building blocks to help you generate natural, usable trees for any scene.

## 🌱 Features

- 🌳 **One-Click Tree Generator**  
  Instantly create a procedural tree object with the *Simple Tree Generator* node group applied.

- 🧩 **Modular Geometry Node Assets**  
  Includes a variety of reusable components:
  - **Simple Wind Effects** for swaying animation
  - **Branch Generators** for dynamic branching structures
  - **Custom Leaf Support** — use any mesh object as a leaf

- 🎛️ **Presets & Customization**  
  Select from a few preconfigured presets, or explore the node group for full control.

- 🎨 **UV Mapping + Materials Ready**  
  - All generated trees come with **UV coordinates** for bark texturing
  - Includes a handful of fun **CC0 bark textures from [ambientCG.com](https://ambientcg.com)**
  - Easily swap in your own materials or shaders
